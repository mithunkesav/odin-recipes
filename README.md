Html basic project


This is the first project of the Odin project. This aims to teach about the basics of html language. 

The project involves setting up an html page that has an index page that contains the link to 3 recipes. Once we click on the link of any recipe it will take us to that particular recipe. That page will have a photo of the recipe, a small description, list of incredients and some steps to prepare the recipe.

Now let's start the project !!!
